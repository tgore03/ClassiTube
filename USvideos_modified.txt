1. Title: Trending YouTube Video Statistics


2. Sources
   Original dataset was adopted from below URL : 
	https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new
   That data was collected for several countries : US(United states of America), GB(Great Britain), DE(Germany), CA(Canada), and FR(France).
   I chose the data for USA country only.
   I modified the dataset to analyze some hidden information.
   Such as, I removed duplicate video_id's and make use of them to retrieve some meaningful data.
   I removed some unrelated attributes.As per my requirement,I changed type/class of few attributes too.
   I derived some new attributes from existing once.And many other minor modifications.
   
   All the modifications are done by R-Programming.
   
   I also added a new feature called "subscriber" to the dataset.
   I collected all subscriber information from youtube.com ,process was automatically done by a python script,written by me.
