Topic : 
Predicting category of trending youtube videos using supervised learning


Summary of Goals : 
The goal of this project is to categorize the top trending videos on
youtube using different supervised learning methods and compare their performance.
This is done using the dataset containing following features for top trending youtube videos:
● Title
● Category_ID
● Channel_title
● Tags
● Description


Basic Approach to be followed :
1. Preprocessing:
a. This includes converting strings to corresponding numerical values using TF-IDF
b. Performing dimensionality reduction using PCA.

2. Training:
a. Neural Network
b. Logistic Regression

3. Comparing Accuracies:
a. Confusion Matrix
b. Classification Error
c. Training Time


Anticipated Results : 
Given a training and test dataset of the youtube trending videos, our
algorithm will predict the category of videos in test dataset.
